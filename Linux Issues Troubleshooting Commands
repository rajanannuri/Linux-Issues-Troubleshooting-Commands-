Sudo: /bin/bash : command not found in ubuntu :
Ans:- 1. Check if bash is installed:
      # which bash
      If bash is installed, this command will return the path, usually /bin/bash.
      2. Reinstall bash: If bash is not installed or if there is an issue with the installation, reinstall it using
      # sudo apt update
      # sudo apt install --reinstall bash
The above points not found, we need to use, alternative shell.
      **1. Alternative shell: If bash is not available, try using another shell like sh or dash:
        # sudo /bin/bash  - these command will open shell , then we need to install shell by using above commands.
